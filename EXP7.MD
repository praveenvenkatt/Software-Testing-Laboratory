### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
To study the system specifications of an ATM application and report any identified bugs.
### Purpose:
To analyze the functionality and security of an ATM system and ensure it meets the requirements for usability, efficiency, and safety.


### Scope:
The ATM application study focuses on evaluating features like authentication, balance inquiry, withdrawal, deposit, fund transfer, and system security.


### Intended Audience:
This document is intended for software developers, quality assurance testers, system analysts, and stakeholders interested in understanding the ATM application requirements and potential issues.


### Product Perspective:
The ATM application serves as an interface between users and their banking services. It allows users to perform transactions and check balances without visiting a bank branch


### Product Functions:
User Authentication: Secure login using PIN or biometric authentication.
Balance Inquiry: Display current account balance.
Cash Withdrawal: Allow users to withdraw cash within their account limits.
Cash Deposit: Enable cash deposits into the account.
Fund Transfer: Transfer funds between accounts.
Mini-Statement: Display the last 5-10 transactions.


### Operative Environments:
Operating Systems: Windows, Linux (ATM-specific systems)
Hardware: ATM machines equipped with card readers, PIN pads, screens, cash dispensers, and deposit slots.


### Design/implementation constraints: 
Hardware Limitations: Limited display size and processing power.
Network Dependency: Transactions rely on stable network connections with the bankâ€™s server.
Security Constraints: Must comply with industry standards for encryption and data protection.


### Assumptions and Dependencies: 
Assumes users are familiar with ATM operations.
Depends on stable internet connections and secure bank servers.


### Software interfaces 
Database: To store user account information and transaction history.
Authentication System: For secure login and PIN verification.
Bank Server Interface: For real-time transaction processing.


### Safety requirements: 
Prevent physical harm by including emergency exit or cancel options.
Prevent unauthorized access by logging out users after transactions or inactivity.


### Security requirements: 
All transactions and user data must be encrypted.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.


### Possible Bugs:
Authentication Bug: PIN entry errors or card reader malfunction.
Transaction Errors: Double withdrawal or incorrect balance updates.
Display Issues: Incorrect balance or mini-statement format on screen.
Deposit Failure: Cash deposit not reflected in the account balance.
User Session Timeout: System fails to log out users after inactivity.


### Result:
Thus, the ATM system specifications and reporting the various bugs is implemented and output was verified successfully
